Tic Tac Toe

overview:

 I ensured an engaging two-player experience.
 Players take turns marking squares on a 3x3 grid, aiming to achieve a row, column, or diagonal of their symbol (either "X" or "O"). 
The game dynamically switches between players, providing an immersive interactive experience. I implemented a user-friendly reset button that allows players to easily start a new game at any time. 
This feature enhances the overall usability and enjoyment of the game by providing a seamless transition between rounds.

Prodigy Infotech:
As a proud member of the Prodigy Infotech internship program, I'm thrilled to showcase the culmination of my journey: my integral role in crafting a dynamic Tic Tac Toe game. 
This immersive experience not only enabled me to sharpen my programming prowess but also provided an opportunity to delve deep into game development concepts.
